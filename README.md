Seach over your keybinds if you forget them

1. fork the repo to add your own bindings
2. use `go install github.com/JNickson/nvim-simple-keybind-helper@latest` - install to your $GOBIN | change for your repo
3. Create an alias if you like to the filepath: `alias vim-keybinds="/Users/jnickson/usr/local/go/nvim-simple-keybind-helper"`

Update the `main.go` - [table-rows](https://github.com/JNickson/nvim-simple-keybind-helper/blob/main/main.go#L136) with whatever keybinds you want to recall on
